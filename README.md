# nix-darwin

The configuration of my MacBook Pro using Nix-Darwin and flakes. Feel free to use as reference.

I was using the official Nix installer, but opted for the [Determinate System's Nix Graphical installer](https://determinate.systems/posts/graphical-nix-installer/) for a fresh start and to follow [a guide](https://nixcademy.com/2024/01/15/nix-on-macos/).
